There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings):
        n = len(ratings)
        candies = [1] * n
        
        # First pass: left to right
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1
        
        # Second pass: right to left
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
                candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)
        
        return sum(candies)
